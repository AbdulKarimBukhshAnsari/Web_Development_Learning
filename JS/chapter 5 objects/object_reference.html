        // Learning object reference 
        // If we defined an object by the name of the var then it will be pointed not the original object but it defines the refernce of the object 
        // so if we make copy then it will make another refernce so if we make changes in the first one the changes will reflect in another object as well.
        // this is the opposition of another var like 
        let x = {num:1};
        let y = x;
        y.num = 2;
        // The changes will reflect in another object as well
        // If we print the x num and y num the answer will be 2 for both 
        // Comparison of two objects
