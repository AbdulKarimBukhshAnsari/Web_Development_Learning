        // Objects is a data type which is used to store the related objects in same variable , in objects we can define another object and fuction as well If we define another object in one object then this is called as nested objetcs
        // Creating object 
        let product = {company : 'Apple' , model : 'Iphone 16' , price : '100000' , display_price :function(){console.log(this.price); return 0 ;} };

        // To acccess the conent of the function which is defined in the object 
        product.display_price();
        // WE can also access the properties of the object by putting the keys in the square brackets
        // But we must have to put in the single quoma or double quoma key it also gives benefit when if the key is string data type
