        let sum_modify = (num1,num2) => num1+num2;
        // but this thing can be done only when the functions have only one line if the function has multiple lines then it is not a god practice to do this 
        console.log(sum_modify(5,6)); // answer will be same that is 11
        // this is arrrow functions in which we just don't use the function keyword and make the function by using the arrows
