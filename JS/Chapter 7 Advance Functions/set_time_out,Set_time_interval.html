        If we want to execute some code after the fix time of interval then we use 
        seTimeout and setTimeinterval , the primary difference between both of them is nothing is just if we want to execute any 
        thing only once then we use first one otherwise we use 2nd one 
        both function will take 2 arguments 
        1) Function as an argument don't make mistake by calling in the setTimeoue 
        2)The time which it will take only in milli seconds i.e (2000 ->2seconds)
        */
        function alarm(){
            console.log("Subah hogai uth jao ");
        }
        let timer_id = setTimeout(alarm,10000); // I am not calling the alarm function in the setTimeout and I am giving the time which is 10 second

        // Howwever if you want to clear the timeout that this thing should not be happend then you can just use clearTimeout function 
        // You have to just provide the ID of that timer and luckily the timeout function returns its id by itself

        clearTimeout(timer_id); // now the above timer wil not do its work 

        let interval_id = setInterval(() => console.log('kese ho ') , 2000); // using arrows functions as an argument and after each 2 second this thing will happen
        // you can also use the clear function to clear the interval if we want to clear the interval after 4 seconds
        setTimeout(() => clearInterval(interval_id),4000); // this function will work after 4 seconds
